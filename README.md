### WHY ?
I believe we could be more effective in everything we do. If only we would be more aware of whats going on inside our minds and bodies.
### HOW ?
We need to be reminded to look inside and adjust our behaviour.
### WHAT ?
This is a mobile app that tracks heart rate using bluetooth strap device.

Shows heart rate coherence indication and uses vibration alerts to remind you when coherence is below threshold.

Provides animation to use your breath to influence you heart rate.

PS: This is app has a lot of space for improvement (better methods of coherence calculation, better UI, more features, etc.)
